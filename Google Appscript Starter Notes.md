# Google Appscript Starter Notes



- Close the repository starter kit (see README).
- Delete the folders ".git" and "src", start with a clean slate.
- Before creating a project with npx clasp create..., make sure to create a folder named "dist" where all the files for upload will reside.
- create a project using command "npx clasp create --type sheets --title 'My Project' --rootDir ./dist"
- make sure that .clasp.json file is located on the root folder of your project.
- Edit webpack.config.js:
  - under module.exports, set mode = 'production'
- On appscript.json, set the necessary oAuth scopes.
